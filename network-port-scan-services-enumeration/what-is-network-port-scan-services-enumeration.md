# What is network port scan/services enumeration?

Network services enumeration can be used to gather more information such as service name and version about a particular service that is found to be running from the initial discovery phase. This includes services such as HTTP/HTTPS, DNS, SSH, etc.

_<mark style="background-color:red;">NOTE</mark>_: Enumeration is different from vulnerability scanning (discussed below), as the information gathered from this phase might not lead to a direct exploit, but rather gives a better foothold on the target
