# Service misconfigurations

Windows services are managed by the **Service Control Manager** (_**SCM**_). The _**SCM**_ is a process that is in charge of the management of the state of services, such as the current status, and any configurations of it.&#x20;

Each service that is present on a Windows machine will have an associated executable which will be ran by the _**SCM**_ whenever a particular service is started. The user account which the service will run as will also be specified.

**View the configuration of a particular service with the `sc qc` command**:

```powershell
C:\> sc qc [service_name]
[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

SERVICE_NAME: [service_name]
        TYPE               : ...
        START_TYPE         : 2   AUTO_START
        ERROR_CONTROL      : 1   NORMAL
        BINARY_PATH_NAME   : [exec_path] [flags/options]
        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   :
        TAG                : 0
        DISPLAY_NAME       : ...
        DEPENDENCIES       :
        SERVICE_START_NAME : [account]
```

The important fields to take note of are `BINARY_PATH_NAME` and `SERVICE_START_NAME`.&#x20;

a) `BINARY_PATH_NAME`: The associated executable

b) `SERVICE_START_NAME`:  The account used to run the service
