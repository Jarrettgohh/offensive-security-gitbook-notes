# Unquoted service path

Given a particular service that is configured to call an executable at an unquoted path, it can be exploited to trick the service into running a different exectuable - controlled by us.

Lets compare two services:

1. ...
2. ...

```
C:\> sc qc [service_name]
[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

SERVICE_NAME: windowsscheduler
        TYPE               : ...
        START_TYPE         : 2   AUTO_START
        ERROR_CONTROL      : 0   IGNORE
        BINARY_PATH_NAME   : C:\insecure\permissions\bin.exe
        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   :
        TAG                : 0
        DISPLAY_NAME       : [display_name]
        DEPENDENCIES       :
        SERVICE_START_NAME : srv_user
```
