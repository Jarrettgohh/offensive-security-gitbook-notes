# Insecure permissions on service executable

Suppose we have found a service with executable that has insecure permissions (eg. `C:\insecure\permissions\bin.exe`). The account is `srv_user`.

```powershell
C:\> sc qc [service_name]
[SC] QueryServiceConfig SUCCESS

SERVICE_NAME: windowsscheduler
        TYPE               : ...
        START_TYPE         : 2   AUTO_START
        ERROR_CONTROL      : 0   IGNORE
        BINARY_PATH_NAME   : C:\insecure\permissions\bin.exe
        LOAD_ORDER_GROUP   :
        TAG                : 0
        DISPLAY_NAME       : [display_name]
        DEPENDENCIES       :
        SERVICE_START_NAME : srv_user
```

The following command (`icacls`) allows us to view the permissions of the executable:

```powershell
C:\>icacls C:\insecure\permissions\bin.ex
```
