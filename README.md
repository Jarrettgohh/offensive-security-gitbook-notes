# Introduction

The content serves to list my experimentation and learning based on technical readings, online courses/videos, and my own imagination.&#x20;

If you notice any mistakes or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to contact me at [jarrettgxz.sec@gmail.com](mailto:jarrettgxz.sec@gmail.com). Your feedback is greatly appreciated, thank you!

Without further ado, let's hack away!



> This document was supported by OpenAI's ChatGPT, which was used to generate ideas, provide validation, and clarify technical concepts.&#x20;
>
> However, most of the core theories and principles discussed in this documentation were developed and tested by me, based on research and experimentation conducted to the best of my abilities.



_I have received my inspiration and knowledge hugely from the content provided by the following sources:_

### Shell prompt convention

The `$` symbol will be used to indicate a shell prompt (defaulting to _Bash_). Some commands may require _root_ privileges via the `sudo` command. However, this documentation will not explicitly specify when `sudo` is required â€”  it should be prepended where necessary.
