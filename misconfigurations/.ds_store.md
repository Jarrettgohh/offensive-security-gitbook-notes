  The .DS_Store file is a hidden file (period at the start) created by the
  Finder application in macOS. It is typically used to enhance user experience
  by storing folder-specific metadata.

# .DS\_Store

Due to possible misconfigurations, `.DS_Store` files may be accidentally exposed on web servers. This can lead to disclosure of sensitive information such as directory structure, file names, metadata and more. Such information can be heavily leveraged by an attacker â€” for example, to perform directory traversal, discover hidden files, expose additional endpoints, thereby increasing the overall exploitation scope. These factors contributes to the attacker's information gathering efforts and can aid in further exploitation of the system.
