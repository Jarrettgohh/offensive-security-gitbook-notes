  Finder application in macOS. IT contains information such as: metadata, icon
  positions, etc.

# .DS\_Store

Due to possible misconfigurations, this file may be accidentally exposed on web servers. This can disclose sensitve informations such as: directory structure, file names, metadata and more. These information can be heavily leveraged by an attacker â€” for example, to perform directory traversal, discover hidden files, expose additional endpoints, thereby increasing the overall exploitation scope. These factors contributes to the attacker's information gathering efforts and can aid in further exploitation of the system.
