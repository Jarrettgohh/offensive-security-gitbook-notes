### Reverse shell

Given a scenario where an attacker has gained remote code execution privileges on a victim machine, a reverse/bind shell can be established to allow the attacker to gain a remote shell session on the victim machine.

A reverse shell works by establishing a connection from the target machine with shell execution, to a listening port on the attacker's machine. This allows any commands sent from the attacker's machine to be executed by the shell on the victim's machine, allowing a remote shell environment.

### Bind shell

A bind shell works in an opposite way to a reverse shell, such that the connection is established from attacker machine to the target machine on a specific listening port (enabled by the attacker).&#x20;
