# Hash database

Hashes are usually encrypted in a way that is made to be extremely difficult to decrypt, unlike the common encryption. Thus, it is usually computationally unfeasible to attempt to decrypt a particular hash (reverse the process and recover the original input from the hash). A database of known hash-to-value can be helpful in discovering the value that was hashed. &#x20;

## CrackStation

CrackStation is an online database search engine service with a database that has access to billions of hash-to-value results. This service can be useful for discovering the value of a hash.
